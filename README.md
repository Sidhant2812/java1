# Titan Health App
A comprehensive web application that seamlessly combines exercise and nutrition tracking while offering intelligent, personalized suggestions to guide users' health and fitness journeys. 

## Workspace Setup
To clone the repository onto your local machine, run `git clone https://github.com/yyu2002/Titan_Health_App.git` in the directory you want the repository to be cloned into.

We used [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager for our application and recommend it. Install yarn by running `npm install yarn`. We will be managing the versions of node modules separately for front and backend.

## Running the Application

#### Running the Backend (Server)
Navigate to the `/backend/` directory. Before starting the server, run `yarn` to update existing node modules or install any missing node module dependencies. Then run `yarn start` to start the backend server. 

#### Running the Frontend (Client)
Navigate to the `/frontend/` directory. Before starting the server, run `yarn` to update existing node modules or install any missing node module dependencies. Then run `yarn start` to start the backend server. 

## Development

For more details on how to use yarn as a package manager, see the [yarn CLI documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/).

#### Installing New Modules (Dependencies)
To install a new dependency required, navigate to either the frontend or backend directory, then run `yarn add <module_name>` to install the new module in its desired location.

#### Pushing New Changes
The follow requirements must be met before pushing changes onto the `main` branch:
- Must be an invited contributor to the repository
- Must have 1 approval from another contributor
- Must have 1 approval from the repository owner (yyu2002)
